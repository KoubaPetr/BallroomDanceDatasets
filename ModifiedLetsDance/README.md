# Modified Let's Dance

Directory containing the structure of the 'Modified Let's Dance' dataset - structure similar to 'Tutorials Dataset' - see corresponding folder for details.

Script download_and_edit.py downloads the dataset into cut_videos/ folder. Rest of the scripts and the folder dataset_textfiles_parsed serve for the reproduction of the links from the Lets Dance dataset (but this is not necessary to get the dataset) - to this end the RGB representation of the dataset has to be downloaded from its authors (https://www.cc.gatech.edu/cpl/projects/dance/) and unzipped into rgb/ folder.
